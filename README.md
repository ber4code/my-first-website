# This be me very 1st webpage

**Welcome!**

This is a sample project undertaken in the _3rd Module_ of my _Coding Bootcamp_ with the **_Code Institute_**.

It is a website that outlines all the facilities and tools that are to be integrated throughout the full course.
_________________

It is a **_3-page interactive website_** which displays the various technologies utilised in the different sections of the coursework. The interface of each page consists of a **__navigation bar__** along the top, as well as the titles and logos of each of the technologies. These are **__clickable hyperlinks__** which when activated, take the user to a dedicated wikipedia page that describes that particular technology.

This is a resource which can be used throughout the course to solidify your understanding of the various technologies. So far, we have explored the worlds of:

| HTML    | CSS | Cloud9  | Git            | GitHub           |
